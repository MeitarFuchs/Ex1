-Ex1 project-
our project is about functions.
our four classs are Monom, Polynom, ComplexFunction and Function_Gui are typs of function.
you can use our Java project to solve math problems(in the class typs) and calculate function(by divid/mul/plus/min/mas/comp tools).

Monom class:
including MonomZero, MonomMinus1.
The "Monom" object realizing 3 different constructors, print the monom, equals between to monoms and adding monom to monom.
calculation function: multiplication / derivative of the monom and the value of the polynom at x.

Polynom class:
The "Polynom" object realizing 2 different constructors, equals between two polynoms, create copy of the polynom to new one and print the polynom.
calculation function: adding polynom to polynom/monom to polynom,
                      subtraction of Polynom from Polynom,
                      multiplication of monom/polynom with polynom,
                      computation of area, 
                      derivative, 
                      integral calculation,
                      roots of the polynom,
                      the value of the polynom at x.

Complex functions class:
The "Polynom" object realizing complex function that can be composed of Monom,Polynom, and ComplexFunction himself.
complexFunction have an operation , left function and right function.
Function_Gui class:
 This class can read from file, save to file and drwe your complex fumction (alse from json file).
